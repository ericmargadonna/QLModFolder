# QLModFolder
The mod folder for Quake Lanes remote development.

This is the *actual folder* that should be placed in the "...\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4\" directory

If you wish to view the source code for this mod, or even edit it yourself, please see my other repository [here](https://github.com/ericmargadonna/Game-Mod-Q4/)
