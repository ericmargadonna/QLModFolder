What's been done:
    -initialized variable for cardbattlehud in player.h
    -added reference to cardbattlehud in the player.def file under Player Entity Definition
    -added references to and loaded new cardbattlehud in player.cpp around line 1855, in the spawn function

What has to be figured out:
    -Call up my custom UI when any damage is taken/given by the player
    -Add deck to player (variables and gui)
    -Add card type (card.cpp + card.h)?
    -Tie damage into card game
    -Add cards to save file
    -Let player keep some things when they die
    -Restart game on player death
    -Change behavior of weapon pickups; this should trigger card mixing gui
    -Build interactive UI
        -Add start screen with deck builder and instructions/mod description


Things I know how to do:
    -Add the readme.md
    -Finish modding the main menu

Notes:
    -Much of the actual fighting will likely be done though scripts/NamedEvents in the gui editor
    -These are called on in code through gui->HandleNamedEvent()

    -For the behavior/logic aspect of the mod, I think I will have to create a few new SysCmds
     that handle's the calling up of the battle gui and dealing with damage/health

    -In gui scripts:
        onAction
        {
            consoleCMD "map game/airdefense1" ;

            //This sets the command
            
            
            set "cmd" "play main_menu_selection" ;

            //And this runs it, I have to look into how to create this
            //in a custom gui
        }
