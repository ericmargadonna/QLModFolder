initialized variable for cardbattlehud in player.h
added reference to cardbattlehud in the player.def file under Player Entity Definition
added references to and loaded new cardbattlehud in player.cpp around line 1855, in the spawn function

many of my goals seem to be accomplishable though the scripts/NamedEvents in the gui editor
These are called on through gui->HandleNamedEvent()
